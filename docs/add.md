# Description

Use this command to add named layers to the map from among those distributed with *nswtopo*. Refer to the website for a description of the various layers. Use the `nswtopo layers` command to display a list of available layers.

Layers are arranged hierarchically, with some layers being shorthand for a collection of other layers. For example, the `nsw/topographic` layer contains a large number of component layers, such as `nsw/topographic/roads`, `nsw/topographic/watercourses` etc.

The forward-slash character is used indicate the nested folder structure of these layers. However, once added to the map, these layers are renamed with periods (`nsw.topographic.watercourses`), and the use of period and slash characters is interchangeable.

# Options

Some layers, such as vegetation layers, require a dataset to be present on your computer. Specify the location of the dataset with the `--path` option. The path can be absolute, or relative to the working directory.

Raster layers (vegetation, shaded relief) are typically imported at the data's native resolution. If desired, you can choose a different value using the `--resolution` option, for a data resolution in metres per pixel, or the `--ppi` option for output resolution in pixels per inch.

For repeated use, it's easier to set the path or resolution for a layer in a permanent configuration file. Use the *config* command for this task.

# Positioning Layers

By default, layers are added to the map in an appropriate position for the type: vegetation and aerial layers first, followed by topographic feature layers, overlays, shaded relief, grid, declination and controls.

To instead select a specific position for the new layer, use the `--after` or `--before` option with an existing layer name. For example, to insert a KML overlay between existing topographic layers:

```
$ nswtopo add --after nsw.topographic.urban-areas map.tgz new-suburb.kml
```

# Other Layers

While *grid*, *declination*, overlay and *controls* layers each have a dedicated command, it's possible to add them directly if you don't need to change default settings:

```
$ nswtopo add map.tgz out-of-bounds.kml grid controls.gpx
```

Georeferenced rasters (e.g. GeoTIFFs) can also be added directly:

```
$ nswtopo add map.tgz underlay.tif
```

For advanced users, custom layer definitions can added by referencing the `.yml` definition file:

```
$ nswtopo add --after nsw.topographic.water-areas map.tgz bathymetry.yml
```

# Failed Layers

Map servers can sometimes be uncooperative, resulting in layers which fail to download. In this event, simply run the `add` command again to retry the failed layers. Existing layers will not be re-downloaded.

TAS Topo Map Templates
======================

Sample configuration file for each 1:25k TAS topo map. Templates include:

- tas/tasveg layer
- tas/topographic layer
- tas/reserves layer
- intuitive shaded-relief depiction
- UTM grid

An index for the map sheets can be examined [here](https://www.tasmap.tas.gov.au/do/category/25000DIG).

## How to Use the Templates

Select a map of your choice and copy its `.cfg` file into a new folder as `nswtopo.cfg`. Optionally, tweak the configuration file to suit your needs. The last step is to run `nswtopo.rb` as usual.
